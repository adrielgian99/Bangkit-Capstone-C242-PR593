Here is our repository for the Bangkit 2023 Capstone project - Cloud Computing.

## DESCRIPTION
Cloud Computing have responsible for creating and managing APIs, databases and servers. We also provide services needed by Machine Learning divisions, so that the features we have designed in this project, the data and information entered by users , such as names, images, feedback, and others can be properly used, stored and maintained.

## TOOLS
- JavaScript
- Node js
- Framework : express
- Google Cloud Platform
- Postman


## CLOUD ARCHITECTURE
![OsicheckCloudArchitecture](https://github.com/adrielgian99/Bangkit-Capstone-C242-PR593/blob/b936fe0b18f337f859c5d695fb800e414844927e/assets/Obesicheck%20cloud%20architecture.jpg)

## API Description
The API is built using node js and express js as our API framework, we use cloud run to deploy backend, machine learning model 1 and 2, and also use Firestore Database to store user account data, prediction output, etc and utilize Google Cloud Storage to store activity and food images.

## API URL

<br>
<br>
We create an ERD design before starting to develop our application cloud structure. This really helps us in managing files and data such as information about user account, user details, machine learning model output, and also activity and food image url and descriptions.

## SECURITY
To access our APIs, we use JasonWebTokenor "JWT" to authenticate and authorize user access to our APIs.
